"""The three engines of the hetero_soc board.

  cva6    the orchestrator. Runs the whole Deeploy Generic mapping, so it is
          the engine that can execute anything, and the one every node falls
          back to.
  snitch  the 9-core Snitch cluster with the Xssr/Xfrep sequencers. Offloads
          MatMul, Gemm and Conv2d; those are the kernels runtime/snitch/kernels
          implements against the two extensions.
  spatz   the Snitch/Spatz pair. Same three operators, autovectorized to RVV.

A cluster engine only claims a node it can really run, which is narrower than
"the operator appears in my mapping":

  * fp32 only -- the cluster kernels are the fp32 ones. This cannot be decided
    from the ONNX dtypes alone: Deeploy infers the real element type from the
    input data, so a graph whose tensors are declared float32 but hold integer
    values is deployed as an integer network. The generator therefore tells the
    cluster engines whether the network came out fp32, and they decline
    everything if it did not -- an integer network runs entirely on the host.
  * the working set has to fit the cluster scratchpad. The Spatz pair cannot
    compute on anything outside its TCDM at all (its vector load/store unit is
    wired to the scratchpad), and the Snitch cluster would fall back to running
    against main memory, which the measurements say is 5-8x slower.

Getting this wrong is not a performance bug, it is a correctness one, so
canExecute is where it is enforced rather than in the cost model.
